        <h3>Travel & Hunt</h3>
        <p>The late Riddle Master hid his treasures all over the world and mystic glyphs are the clues that lead to them. Typically, glyphs are located near landmarks and tourism areas.</p>
        <p>While serious hunters strive to become the Master's successor, amateur glyphs hunting is a good activity for travelers who want to add some adventurous elements to their trip.</p>

        <h3>Missions & Campaigns</h3>
        <p>There are glyphs all over the world and our search team is working hard to identify them. To begin, select the cities with glyphs identified.</p>
        <p>Every mission consists of 6 glyphs, completing a mission leads to the next. Each campaign, typically made up of 3-4 missions, covers popular landmarks in an area and takes 3-4 hours to complete.</p>

        <h3>Glyphs & Activation Clues</h3>
        <p>Each glyph presents a challenge. Solving a glyph progresses you toward mission completion and provides you with additional information for the other glyphs in the mission.</p>
        <p>When at least 4 glyphs are solved, activation clue for the next mission becomes available. Some glyphs are super challenging so you don't have to solve all of them, 4 is enough!</p>
